‚ú® Aetheria - AI-Powered Dream Weaver Landing Page ‚ú®
üöÄ Project Overview
This repository contains the code for "Aetheria," a creative multi-section landing page designed as a submission for the "Deploy with an Animation" tasks for the Campus Ambassador (CA) program at Techfest, IIT Bombay. The project evolved from a single-section page to a more dynamic, multi-section experience, integrating advanced UI/UX animations using GSAP.

üí° The Fictional Startup: Aetheria
Aetheria - AI-Powered Dream Weaver is a conceptual startup focused on revolutionizing how we interact with our subconscious. Imagine a service that leverages advanced AI to visualize and interpret your dreams, transforming abstract nocturnal experiences into tangible, shareable insights. This landing page aims to capture the ethereal, innovative, and slightly mysterious essence of such a venture, inviting users into a world where dreams become a new form of data.

üåü Key Features
Multi-Section Design: Expanded from a single section to a comprehensive landing page with dedicated sections for Hero, Features, About Us, and Contact, providing a richer user journey.

Pure HTML & CSS: Developed entirely without external frameworks (like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) or JavaScript libraries (beyond GSAP for animations), strictly adhering to the task's constraints. This demonstrates a deep understanding of core web technologies.

Dynamic Hero Animation: The main headline "Aetheria" features a custom CSS @keyframes animation (dreamGlow) that creates a subtle, pulsating glow and dynamic movement, beautifully embodying the "dream weaver" concept.

GSAP-Powered UI Animations:

Navbar Slide-In: The navigation bar gracefully slides in from the top on page load, providing a smooth and professional entrance.

Button Hover Pulse: All call-to-action buttons subtly scale and enhance their shadow on hover, offering engaging and purposeful feedback.

Scroll-Triggered Fade-Ins: As the user scrolls, the "Features," "About Us," and "Contact" sections animate into view with elegant fade-in and subtle upward motion, guiding the user through the content.

Subtle Background Particles: Animated particles (floatAndFade) in the background add depth, motion, and a magical, ethereal touch to the overall aesthetic, enhancing the dream-like atmosphere.

Fully Responsive Layout: Designed to look great and function seamlessly across various device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using modern responsive CSS techniques like clamp() for font sizing, ensuring a consistent user experience.

Semantic HTML5: Structured with meaningful HTML tags for better accessibility, maintainability, and search engine optimization.

Smooth Scroll Navigation: Implemented JavaScript for smooth scrolling between sections when clicking on navigation links.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: The backbone of the page, providing robust structure and content organization.

CSS3: Utilized for all styling, layout, and the intricate custom animations (@keyframes).

JavaScript: For integrating GSAP and handling interactive elements.

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): A powerful JavaScript animation library used for the Navbar slide-in, Button hover effects, and Scroll-Triggered section animations.

gsap.min.js

ScrollTrigger.min.js (GSAP plugin for scroll-based animations)

Google Fonts (Inter): Imported for a modern, clean, and highly legible typographic style.
