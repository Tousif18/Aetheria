‚ú® Aetheria - AI-Powered Dream Weaver Landing Page ‚ú®
üöÄ Project Overview
This repository contains the code for "Aetheria," a creative one-section landing page designed as a submission for the "Deploy with an Animation" task for the Campus Ambassador (CA) program at Techfest, IIT Bombay. The core objective was to build an eye-catching hero animation using pure HTML and CSS, showcasing both creativity and strong coding fundamentals.

üí° The Fictional Startup: Aetheria
Aetheria - AI-Powered Dream Weaver is a conceptual startup focused on revolutionizing how we interact with our subconscious. Imagine a service that leverages advanced AI to visualize and interpret your dreams, transforming abstract nocturnal experiences into tangible, shareable insights. This landing page aims to capture the ethereal, innovative, and slightly mysterious essence of such a venture, inviting users into a world where dreams become a new form of data.

üåü Key Features
Single-Section Design: A concise and focused landing page experience, delivering its message effectively in one impactful view.

Pure HTML & CSS: Developed entirely without external frameworks (like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) or JavaScript libraries, strictly adhering to the task's constraints. This demonstrates a deep understanding of core web technologies.

Eye-Catching Hero Animation: The main headline "Aetheria" features a custom CSS @keyframes animation (dreamGlow) that creates a subtle, pulsating glow and dynamic movement. This effect beautifully embodies the "dream weaver" concept, making the hero section truly captivating.

Subtle Background Particles: Animated particles (floatAndFade) in the background add depth, motion, and a magical, ethereal touch to the overall aesthetic, enhancing the dream-like atmosphere.

Fully Responsive Layout: Designed to look great and function seamlessly across various device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using modern responsive CSS techniques like clamp() for font sizing, ensuring a consistent user experience.

Semantic HTML5: Structured with meaningful HTML tags for better accessibility, maintainability, and search engine optimization.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: The backbone of the page, providing robust structure and content organization.

CSS3: Utilized for all styling, layout, and the intricate custom animations (@keyframes) that bring the page to life.

Google Fonts (Inter): Imported for a modern, clean, and highly legible typographic style.
