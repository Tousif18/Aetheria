Aetheria - AI-Powered Dream Weaver Landing Page
Project Overview
This repository contains the code for "Aetheria," a creative one-section landing page designed as a submission for the "Deploy with an Animation" task for the Campus Ambassador (CA) program at Techfest, IIT Bombay. The goal was to build an eye-catching hero animation using pure HTML and CSS, showcasing creativity and coding skills.

The Fictional Startup: Aetheria
Aetheria - AI-Powered Dream Weaver is a conceptual startup focused on revolutionizing how we interact with our subconscious. Imagine a service that leverages advanced AI to visualize and interpret your dreams, transforming abstract nocturnal experiences into tangible, shareable insights. This landing page aims to capture the ethereal, innovative, and slightly mysterious essence of such a venture.

Features
Single-Section Design: A concise and focused landing page experience.

Pure HTML & CSS: Developed entirely without external frameworks (like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) or JavaScript libraries, adhering to the task's strict constraints.

Eye-Catching Hero Animation: The main headline "Aetheria" features a custom CSS @keyframes animation (dreamGlow) that creates a subtle, pulsating glow and movement, embodying the "dream weaver" concept.

Subtle Background Particles: Animated particles (floatAndFade) in the background add depth and a magical, ethereal touch to the overall aesthetic.

Responsive Layout: Designed to look great and function seamlessly across various device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using responsive CSS techniques like clamp() for font sizing.

Semantic HTML5: Structured with meaningful HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the page structure and content.

CSS3: For all styling, layout, and custom animations (@keyframes).

Google Fonts (Inter): Imported for modern and clean typography.
